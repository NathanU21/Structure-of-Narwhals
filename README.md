    <p> To start off, the male narwhal, despite its appearances, actually have two large teeth that most would consider "tusks". One tooth would go on for several feet, which is the "tusk" that most people notice when they see narwhals, and another tooth that is significanly smaller, about only one foot actually. Within the larger tooth, the tooth is styled to have constant grooves that continue throughout it, and as a male narwhal continues to age, more layers to this tooth is added. To add on to this, the larger tooth actually has several millions of nerves throughout it, which is mainly used to sense the narwhal's surroundings, creating a new perception towards its environment for the narwhal. </p>
